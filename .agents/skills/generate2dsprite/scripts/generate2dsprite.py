"""Build sprite prompts and postprocess generated sprite sheets locally.

``process`` keys or validates a sheet, splits it into cells and places every
frame on one output grid (geometry v2):

* Geometry (components, boxes, anchors, edge checks, clamping) counts pixels
  with alpha above ``--alpha-geometry-threshold`` (16) and labels 8-connected
  components; the threshold never changes a pixel.
* ``native_alpha`` input gets ``--alpha-hygiene both``: generator haze and
  detached faint specks are removed and counted.
* Anchors sit on the ground line, the bottom edge of the main component's
  lowest row (``--anchor-mode feet``), measured on the subject itself.
* ``preserve`` and ``registered`` resample every cell on one shared sampling
  grid and move frames by whole output pixels only; ``nearest`` accepts
  integer scales only (``--pixel-scale``, ``--logical-pixel``).
* Scale QC is measured in output pixels; new scale profiles are version 2.

Every changed default keeps a legacy switch: ``--connectivity 4``,
``--anchor-mode legacy-p98``, ``--alpha-geometry-threshold 0``,
``--alpha-hygiene none``, ``--legacy-fractional-nearest``,
``--key-quality hard``, ``--profile-override`` and
``build-prompt --legacy-style``.
